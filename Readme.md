# Ecological Overshoot and Social Shortfall Visualization

This repository contains a Python script for building an interactive choropleth world map. It features sliders and play/stop buttons that display how countries' performance concerning planetary boundaries and social foundation has changed over time (from 1990 to 2015).

The visualization is based on the analysis from [Fanning et.al 2021 The social shortfall and ecological overshoot of nations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00799-z), which provides detailed data on how different countries overshoot planetary boundaries. By altering the entries in the column_name_lst in the Python script, different ecological planetary boundaries can be selected for visualization.
